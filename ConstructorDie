class MSDie:

    def __init__(self,sides): ### REMEMBER the __init__
        self.sides = sides
        self.value = 1
        ###instance variables here's 2 examples. an instance variable always starts with self.Whatever

    def roll(self):
        self.value = randrange(1, self.sides+1)
    ### This uses the random genrator that's why it only needs one value starts at one 
        
    def getValue(self):
        return self.value
    
    def setValue(self, value):
        self.value = value

### for constructor self!!!!!!! is always the first value, of the variables

def main():
    #create new instance of the MSDie Class
    msd = MSDie(9)
    ##start working with the die this gives the Die 1-9 possiblity NOT 9 faces
    #######print(msd.getValue()) try this to see the default value, should be 1 since it's in the constructor

    for i in range(10):
        msd.roll()
        print(msd.getValue())

###Create a 2nd object
        
    msd2 =MSDie(20)
    
    print ("Second die")

    for i in range(5):
        msd2.roll()
        print(msd2.getValue())
